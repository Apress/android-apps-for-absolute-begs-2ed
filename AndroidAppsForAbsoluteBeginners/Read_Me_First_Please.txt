READ ME FIRST PLEASE!

The folders in this .ZIP file hold the code and assets for the seven example applications in the Android Apps for Absolute Beginners Second Edition book from Apress. The New Media Assets are in the Assets_Folders and are classified by type: Assets_Animation, Assets_Audio and Assets_Images. These new media assets will be placed into Drawable and Raw sub-folders in your Project's Resources folder as instructed in the book.

The other seven folders are named by their Project Name, and contain sub-folders holding the text file format Java and XML files that go under the Source and Resource folders underneath your primary Project Folder. This should be fairly obvious by the folder names that I have used in this ZIP archive. Unzip this archive using the "Use Folder Names" option in order to keep this folder structure intact, or simply pull files out of this ZIP archive as needed.

The files in the Assets_Audio folder need to be renamed based on which type of audio you want to use in your app, all of these formats are supported by Android. If you want to use MP3 then rename mindtaffymp3.mp3 to mindtaffy.mp3 and place the file into the Raw folder under your Project folder. Make sure that you do not have more than one mindtaffy.audio_codec file at a time in that folder, as the Java code references this asset using the first part of the file name only.

Finally, Android 4.2 added an XXHDPI Drawable Classification into Android 4.2, probably to handle 1920 by 1080 HDTV 16:9 Aspect Ratio (GoogleTV) as well as 1920 by 1200 HDTV 16:10 Aspect Ratio (Large Tablets) Content. I did not have time to add this into CH4 and CH8 of the book, so I am mentioning it here, so that you know about it. Enjoy the Book!
